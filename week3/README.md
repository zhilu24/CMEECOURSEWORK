# PROJECT NAME: BOOTCAMP ASSIGNMENT WEEK 3

## Project Overview: 
This project include two parts.
The first part is introduce the use of R for biological computing. The focus is on building foundational skills in R programming, introducing data structures, control flow, vectorization and reproducible workflows. It also cover debugging, and using R for analysis and modelling.
The second part is focuse on exercises related to data management and visualization in biological data. This project explore key principles like data wrangling, reshaping, and advanced visualization techniques using R and its packages.

## Languages and Tools Used:

### programming Language: R
A language widely used for data analysis, statistical computing, and creating visualizations.

### Main Tools:
 - R base functions (eg. plot)
 - R packages: reshape2, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse
 - Data visualization tool like ggplot2 
 - IDEs: RStudio or Visual Studio COde

## Dependencies/Installation:
R packages

installation: install the required R package use: install.packages("")

## Project Structure and Usage:

### CMEECourseWork/week2

#### -code
#contains 19 practices. 
Except for the visulization.R file, everything else is the content under the first part. 
The visulization.R file focus on the visulization and data management exercises.

#### -data 
#contains CSV data files used in the R practices.

#### -result
#result files generated after script execution

#### -gitignore
#some unrelated files (such as class exercises or tests)
