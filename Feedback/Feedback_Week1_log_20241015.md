# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository is fairly minimal, with only the `Feedback` and `.git` directories found in the parent directory. This suggests that the overall project structure is incomplete or missing important elements such as weekly directories (`week1`, `week2`, etc.). Typically, a CMEE coursework repository should include clearly organized directories for each weekâ€™s work, containing scripts, data, and results, which are currently missing.

### `.gitignore` File
A `.gitignore` file is missing, which is an essential part of any repository. It helps ensure that unnecessary files, such as system files (e.g., `.DS_Store`), temporary files, or results, are not tracked in version control. Adding a `.gitignore` file would be a good practice.

### README File
The main `README.md` file in the parent directory is minimal, containing only the repository name. It would benefit greatly from additional detail, including:
- A description of the purpose of the repository.
- Clear instructions on how to run the scripts.
- Examples of expected input and output.
- Any dependencies or installation instructions needed to run the project.

## Workflow

### Missing Weekly Directories
The log indicates that the weekly directories (`week1`, `week2`, etc.) are missing, which is a significant issue. Each weekly directory is expected to contain the relevant scripts, data, and results for that week's tasks. Without these directories, it is difficult to evaluate the project properly. Be sure to create and structure these directories following standard project guidelines.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. **Add Weekly Directories**:
   - Create separate directories for each week's tasks, such as `week1`, `week2`, etc.
   - Each directory should include:
     - A `code` folder containing the scripts.
     - A `data` folder for any input files used by the scripts.
     - A `results` folder for storing output files generated by the scripts.
   - Each weekly directory should also have its own `README.md` file explaining the contents and how to run the scripts for that week.

### 2. **Create a `.gitignore` File**:
   - The `.gitignore` file should be added to exclude system-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`), temporary files, and results that should not be tracked.
   - A standard `.gitignore` file could include the following:
     ```
     # Ignore system files
     .DS_Store

     # Ignore temporary files
     *.tmp
     *.log

     # Ignore results
     results/*
     ```

### 3. **Enhance the Main README File**:
   - Expand the `README.md` to provide:
     - A description of the project or coursework.
     - Instructions for setting up the environment, including any dependencies.
     - Detailed usage instructions for running the scripts.
     - Examples of input and output.
   - This would make the repository more user-friendly, especially for collaborators or external reviewers.

## Overall Feedback

The repository is missing key structural components, such as weekly directories and a `.gitignore` file, which need to be addressed. Enhancing the `README.md` and ensuring a more structured approach will significantly improve the organization and usability of the project. By adding these elements, the project will follow better coding and project management practices.
