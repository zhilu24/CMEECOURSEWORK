# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository structure follows a clear and logical organization, with key directories such as `week1`, `week2`, `week3`, and a parent README file. This organization makes it easy to navigate the codebase. However, the absence of a `.gitignore` file is an issue that should be addressed. Adding a `.gitignore` file will ensure that unnecessary files (e.g., system files like `.DS_Store` or auto-generated results) are not tracked in version control.

### README Files
The README file for `week1` provides a good overview of the project, describing the UNIX programming and shell scripting exercises. It outlines the exercises and tools used, but it would benefit from more detailed usage instructions, such as:
- Examples of how to run each script.
- The expected input and output of the scripts.
- Clearer information about any dependencies beyond a standard UNIX environment.

## Workflow

### Results Directory
The results directory was missing from the `week1` structure. This directory should be created automatically when running scripts that generate output, or at least the `README.md` should mention the need for this directory.

## Script-Specific Feedback

### 1. **csvtospace.sh**
- **Functionality**: This script checks for valid CSV input and converts it to space-separated values. The logic is well-structured, and error handling is implemented correctly for missing or incorrect input.
- **Improvement**: Add a check to ensure that the results directory exists before saving the output file. If it doesn't exist, the script should create it automatically to avoid errors.

### 2. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh**
- **Functionality**: The script concatenates two input files into a third file, with validation for the number of inputs and matching file extensions.
- **Improvement**: The script would benefit from checking whether the output file already exists to avoid unintentional overwrites. Additionally, more detailed comments explaining the steps would make the script easier to follow.

### 3. **CountLines.sh**
- **Functionality**: The script counts the number of lines in a file.
- **Error Handling**: It fails if no filename is provided, resulting in an "ambiguous redirect" error. Adding proper input validation and error messages would resolve this issue. For example:
   ```bash
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
       echo "Error: No file specified."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

### 4. **tabtocsv.sh**
- **Functionality**: This script converts tab-delimited files into CSV format. The error handling is good, but it lacks a check to prevent overwriting existing files.
- **Improvement**: Implement a check to verify if the output file already exists before saving it, or prompt the user for confirmation before overwriting.

### 5. **tiff2png.sh**
- **Functionality**: The script converts `.tif` files to `.png` using the `convert` command. It works as expected, but it produces an error if no `.tif` files are found.
- **Improvement**: Add a check to see if any `.tif` files are present before attempting to convert them. This will prevent unnecessary errors.

### 6. **UnixPrac1.txt**
- **Functionality**: This script performs several tasks on `.fasta` files, such as counting lines and calculating AT/GC ratios. The script is functional but lacks comments, which makes it difficult to understand for someone unfamiliar with UNIX commands.
- **Improvement**: Add comments to explain each step, especially for the more complex commands involving `tail`, `grep`, and `bc`.

### 7. **boilerplate.sh**
- **Functionality**: A simple shell script that prints a message. It runs without errors and requires no significant changes.
- **Improvement**: The script could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose and structure of a boilerplate.

### 8. **variables.sh**
- **Functionality**: The script demonstrates the use of variables and basic arithmetic operations. However, the use of `expr` for arithmetic is outdated and produces a syntax error when arguments are missing.
- **Improvement**: Replace `expr` with `$((...))` for arithmetic operations. This is a more modern and reliable method:
   ```bash
   MY_SUM=$(($a + $b))
   ```

---

## General Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling**: Many scripts lack error handling for missing files or arguments. Adding input validation across all scripts would make them more robust.
- **Output Handling**: Implement checks to prevent overwriting existing files without warning. This will help avoid accidental data loss.
- **README Enhancements**: Expanding the README files to include specific usage examples, expected input/output formats, and dependencies would improve the usability of the repository for new users or collaborators.
- **Comments**: Some scripts (e.g., `UnixPrac1.txt`) would benefit from more detailed comments explaining the steps being performed.

## Overall Feedback

The project is well-organized, with a logical file structure and functional scripts. With improvements in error handling, output file management, and more detailed documentation, the project will become more robust and user-friendly. The work demonstrates a good understanding of shell scripting, and the overall workflow is reasonably easy to follow - but with some scope for improvement.
