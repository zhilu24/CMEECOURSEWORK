# PROJECT NAME: BOOTCAMP ASSIGNMENT WEEK 2

## Project Overview: 
This project is focused on biological computing in python and basic skills in latex writing. The goal to equip users with a solid foundation in python programming while introducing essential concepts such as data structures, functions, control flow, and the use of scientific packages like Numpy.

## Languages and Tools Used:

### IPython3: 
An enhanced interactive Python shell with advanced features like auto-completion and magic commands.

### Library
 - NumPy: A Python library for numerical computing,especially for handing arrays and matrices.

## Dependencies/Installation:
python 3.x, ipython, Numpy

installation: 1. install dependencies 2. run the script with ipython filename (eg. ipython lc1.py)

## Project Structure and Usage:

### CMEECourseWork/week2

#### -code
#contains seven practice assignments. 

lc1.py, lc2.py, tuple.py and dictionary.py : Focus on tasks related to loop and list comprehensions task.

cfexercise1.py: Related to tasks involving control flow.

align_seqs.py: Used for aligning DNA sequences.

oaks_debugme.py: Addressing the problem of identifying missing oak species.

#### -data 
#contains CSV data files used in the exercise: sequences.csv used with the align_seqs.py script and TestOaksDara.csv used with the oaks_debugme.py script.

#### -result
#result files generated after script execution

#### -gitignore
#some unrelated files (such as class exercises or tests)
