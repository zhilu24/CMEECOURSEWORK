PROJECT NAME: BOOTCAMP ASSIGNMENT WEEK 1

Project Overview: This project is focused on basic UNIX programming practice and shell scripting exercises. The goal is to build familiarity with UNIX commands and scripting using shell scripts. It includes basic tasks such as file manipulation, sequence analysis, and format conversion. 
Key exercises involve: 
1. Building familiarity with UNIX directory structures, working with command arguments, redirections, and pipes
2. Writing shell scripts to automate tasks such as file format conversions and developing robust scripts that check input validity.

Languages and Tools Used:
Shell Scripting (Bash): The scripts are written in Bash
UNIX Commands: Basic UNIX commands like grep, wc, tr, tail, and cat.
 
Dependencies/Installation:
This project does not require any special dependencies beyond a standard UNIX-like environment. All necessary tools should already be available in most UNIX-based systems like Linux or macOS. No additional third-party packages are required.
There is no special installation process for this project.
